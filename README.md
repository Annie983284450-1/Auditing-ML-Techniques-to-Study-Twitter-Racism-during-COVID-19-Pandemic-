### Motivation 
With the rising numbers of COVID-19 cases in the United States since early this year, social conflicts have increased significantly. These conflicts have led to mounting fear, economic downturn, and racism. During this pandemic, there are lots of discussions of COVID-19 on Twitter, including President Trump's "Chinese Virus" tweet. 

### Methodologies
We plan to start with a dataset that contains hand-labeled COVID-related tweet data as well as a classifier to classify tweets as Hateful/Racist [1]. 
We would employ different ways to understand the data and generate features, such as word clouds, n-gram analysis, topic modeling techniques like LDA and sentiment analysis, __TF-IDF?__. 
Different feature extraction approaches, such as word clouds, n-gram analysis, topic modeling techniques like LDA and sentiment analysis could be adopted to provide a thorough understanding of the dataset.
Once we understand the dataset well and have generated features, we would continue to model the data with techniques taught in class, such as unsupervised ML techniques (e.g., KMeans/GMM clustering, SVD-based Latent Semantic Analysis), as well as supervised techniques like Naive Bayes, Logistic regression, SVM, kNN .etc. In addition to learning, we would also explore various feature selection techniques, TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency) normalization, PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and Multi-dimensional Scaling (MDS) for dimensionality reduction.
We would compare the performance of these techniques using the performance metrics taught in class, such as confusion matrix, F-score, etc., and finally, audit them with interpretable ML tools such as SHAP [2] and LIME [3] to explain how the model works. If time permits, we would also explore extending our analysis to a Kaggle Dataset of tweets for April https://www.kaggle.com/smid80/coronavirus-covid19-tweets-early-april}}\footnote{\url{https://www.kaggle.com/smid80/coronavirus-covid19-tweets-late-april.
